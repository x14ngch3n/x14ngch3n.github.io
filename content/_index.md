I am a first-year Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Charles Zhang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~charlesz).

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's (2021) and Masterâ€™s (2024) degrees at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests mainly focus on Static Binary Lifting and its downstream applications.

I devote myself to the [Clearblue](https://clearblueinnovations.org/) research project while playing [Capture-The-Flag](https://ctftime.org/user/121120) in spare time.
